"""
A hyper-fast kd-tree implementation tailored for its application in 'radius' Barnes
interpolation algorithm and thus providing only radius-search functionality.
Uses Numba JIT compiler and numpy arrays to achieve the best performance with the
downside that Python class formalism cannot be used and has to be emulated using
data containers and 'external' functions acting on them.

Assuming the sample points are given by the array `pts`, repeated radius searches on
the corresponding kd-tree can be conducted in this way:

    
# create kd-tree 'instance'
kd_tree = create_kdtree(pts)

# create kd-tree search 'object'
radius = 12.5
kd_tree_search = prepare_search(radius, *kd_tree)

# extract array indices and their distances from returned tuple
res_index, res_sqr_dist, _, _, _ = kd_tree_search

# perform searches using search 'object'
search_pts = np.asarray([[3.2, 7.1], [9.8, -1.6], ...])
for pt in serach_pts:
    radius_search(pt, *kd_tree_search)
    
    # handle results
    for k in range(res_index[-1]):
        # do something with `res_index[k]` and `res_sqr_dist[k]`
        ...

def create_kdtree(pts):
    """
    Creates a balanced kd-tree 'instance' given the N point coordinates `pts`.
    
    In absence of a class concept supported by Numba, the kd-tree 'instance' merely
    consists of a tuple containing the tree structure and the points, which were
    passed to construct it.
    
    The tree is described by N nodes, which themselves are simple integer arrays of
    length 3. Array element 0 contains the index of the root node of the left
    sub-tree, element 1 the index of the root node of the right sub-tree and
    element 2 the index of the parent node. No node is represented by -1.
    The index of the root node of the whole kd-tree is stored in the additionally
    appended N+1-th array element.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pts : numpy ndarray
        A 2-dimensional array of size N x 2 containing the x- and y-coordinates
        (or if you like the longitude/latitude) of the N sample points.

    -------
    tree : numpy ndarray
        A (N+1) x 3 integer array contiaining the index description of the kd-tree.
    pts : numpy ndarray
